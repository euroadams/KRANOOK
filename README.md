# Community Forum 
A large web-based decentralized community forum with 3 categories and over 60 sections.

The community was designed with the primary aim of converging people from all over the universe, to help them build knowledge and relationships at all nooks and crannies of the world.

The platform gives registered members of the community an atmosphere to open a thread (topic) and air their opinions on any particular topic of interest while receiving diverse contributions from people who finds their topic engaging.   

One interesting thing about the community is that as members air their opinions or contribute to topics, they earn community badges and build reputations that in turns help them unlock certain privileges.

I understand that in crafting such an atmosphere, certain rules and regulations must be in place to help govern the do's and don'ts of the community, these have also been put in place by employing a decentralized moderation system that allocates moderation privileges based on reputation and ranking in the community.

The platform also incorporate an ad management system that allow advertisers run ads campaign on the community.
